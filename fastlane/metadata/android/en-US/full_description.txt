Epistolaire dumps SMSes AND MMSes AND their photos to a JSON file on 
the phone storage (so you can copy it whatever way you like, Syncthing -
you name it). The JSON format is relatively simple if you're a developer
but there's an optional tool to convert it to pretty HTML pages if you want
to without effort.
